# About 

This is a Figma prototype based on a Course App for Sheridan students. The application will allow students to see and keep track of their course list and course assignments while also staying active in the community and chatting with peers.

# Top five new desirable functionalities that I have not seen before in any other apps

1. Interactive Course Pathway Planner: A tool that allows users to visually map out their academic journey by selecting their major, interests, and goals. This functionality can suggest course sequences, prerequisites, and electives tailored to their career goals.

2. Real-time Study Groups Creation: Facilitate the formation of study groups by allowing users to create, join, or search for study sessions based on course, topic, or availability. This feature could use location services to suggest nearby group study sessions or offer virtual meet-up options, catering to the expressed need for collaborative learning environments and addressing the latent need for flexible, accessible study support.

3. Augmented Reality (AR) Campus Tours: Offer prospective and new students the ability to explore the campus virtually through AR. This feature can provide a guided tour of important buildings, classrooms, and amenities, making it easier for users to navigate the physical campus. It addresses the latent need for a familiarization tool that enhances the on-campus experience, especially for those unable to visit in person.

4. Skill-Building Modules: Integrate short, course-related skill-building modules that users can complete for bonus points or badges. These could cover topics not fully explored in class, such as specific software tutorials, research methodologies, or soft skills like public speaking. This gamification element not only makes learning more engaging but also addresses the latent need for practical, hands-on experience in various skills.

5. Mentorship Matching System: Develop a platform within the app that connects students with mentors, such as alumni, industry professionals, or senior students. Users can specify their mentorship needs, interests, and availability to be matched with a compatible mentor. This functionality addresses the expressed need for guidance and support while uncovering the latent need for networking opportunities and career advice.
